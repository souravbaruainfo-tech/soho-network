# soho-network
Cisco Packet Tracer project for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network design and configuration.

This project contains a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation of a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network. It demonstrates how to design, configure, and test a functional small-scale network environment for business or home use.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
Implements a basic LAN with routers, switches, and end devices.

Configures IP addressing, DHCP, and basic routing.

Tests end-to-end connectivity across the SOHO network.

ðŸ”¹ Files Included
SOHO.pkt â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer topology for the SOHO network.

ðŸ”¹ How to Run
Open SOHO.pkt in Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x or later).

Verify device connectivity using ping.

Explore the addressing and configuration to understand the design.

ðŸ”¹ Learning Objectives
Understand SOHO network design principles.

Learn basic router/switch configuration.

Practice IP addressing and DHCP setup in a small network.
